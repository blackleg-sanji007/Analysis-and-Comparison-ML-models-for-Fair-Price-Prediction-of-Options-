# Analysis-and-Comparison-ML-models-for-Fair-Price-Prediction-of-Options-
This project explores the the usability of MLP(Multi Layer Perceptron) and other ML models in finding the "fair" price of a options price. The options in this project are synthetically created and replicate the NIFTY option chain (specifically European call options).
